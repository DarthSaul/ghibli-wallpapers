    <p>
        I saw <i>Princess Mononoke</i> for the first time when I was
        eight-years-old. After watching an infinite amount of other films, the
        1997 classic from Studio Ghibli remains my favorite.

        This website was created for those who share my adoration for Studio
        Ghibli films, particularly those directed by the genius Hayao Miyazaki,
        and to my fellow computer nerds. If you spend a lot of time on a
        computer, you know the importance of having a desktop wallpaper that you
        enjoy. I (and countless others) have found that illustrations, stills,
        and other artistic aesthetics derived from the Studio Ghibli library are
        a perfect match for a wonderful wallpaper.
